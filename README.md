My personal modifications to socram8888's "Software backup loader exploit thing for the Sony PlayStation 1".

Changes from original:
- Removes "Swap CD now" section from loading for use with FreePSXBoot exploited memory cards for easier use

For more information on the original project, look at [its section at orca.pet](https://orca.pet/tonyhax/).
